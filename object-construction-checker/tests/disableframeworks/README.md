These are test cases for when we disable the framework supports for AutoValue and Lombok, therefore 
the checker annotation won't be automatically inserted into the code.
These two test cases are adapted from _autovalue/UseAutoValueBuilder.java_ and _lombok/LombokBuilderExample.java_
but removed all `// :: error:` comments.
