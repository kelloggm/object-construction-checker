To use the artifact via the docker image, all that's required is Docker.
We tested the artifact using version 3.3.3 of Docker Desktop on Mac OS X.

If you wish to install the artifact itself outside Docker (following the
"extending our work" instructions in the INSTALLATION.md file), you will also
need a Java 11 JDK.
