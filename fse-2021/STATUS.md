Artifacts evaluated - Reusable: This replication package allows other
researchers to repeat our experiments and to edit the source code.  The Resource
Leak Checker has been incorporated into the [Checker
Framework](https://checkerframework.org) as of version 3.15.0, and it will be
maintained and enhanced going forward, enabling future researchers to build on
our work.

Artifacts evaluated - available: our tool, case studies, and scripts
are all available open-source. We've archived our reproduction package
[here](https://zenodo.org/record/4902322#.YLrTMC1h1TY).
