Artifacts evaluated - Reusable: This replication package allows other
researchers to repeat our experiments and to edit the source code.  We are
currently merging it into a large open-source project
(https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework/pull/4687) to ensure that
it will be maintained and enhanced, enabling future researchers to build on
our work.

Artifacts evaluated - available: our tool, case studies, and scripts
are all available open-source. We've archived our reproduction package
[here](https://zenodo.org/record/4902322#.YLrTMC1h1TY).
